### Overview
This is a course project aiming at developing a shiny application for next word prediction. Dictionaries of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams were pregenerated from provided text files. The Simple Stupid Backoff algorithm was used for the next word prediction. Type in a phrase(s)/sentence(s) and this application would give you one or more sugestions of the likely next word.

### Key Points
The Simple Stupid Backoff algorithm is based on the fact that phrases have short-term memory, i.e., the likely next word can be predicted from only a few immediate previous words. In this application, the quadgram dictionary is first looked up for the word. If not found, the trigram dictionary is used, then the bigram dictionary. If still not found, five most-frequently-occurring words in the unigram dictionary is presented as the suggest word(s). It can be seen that building a high quality and good size ngram dictionary is the key, which requires assembly of many (training) text files and a good memory-ample computer. Similarity of the training text files and the input phrases is another key for successful prediction. Finally, the speed of this application is enhanced with an alphabet indexing mechanism.
